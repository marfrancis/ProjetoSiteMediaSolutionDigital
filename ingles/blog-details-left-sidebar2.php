                                <h2>25 Common SEO Questions and Their Answers</h2>
                                <p>If you are just starting an e-commerce store or a company website and are looking for ways to make it popular, one thing that you’d come across quite frequently is SEO. The search engines and SEO professionals have already published thousands of articles on SEO and how one can improve the ranking of their websites on search engines like Google and Bing.</p>

                                <p>But with search engines changing their ranking algorithms on a regular basis and SEO professionals disagreeing with each other’s ranking strategies, it can be quite difficult for someone new to grasp what SEO is. To eliminate this confusion once and for all, we are answering 25 of the most commonly asked SEO questions. Go through all of them and by the end of the post, you’d probably have answers to your queries too.</p>

                                
                                
                                <h3>1. What is SEO?</h3>
                                <p>Search Engine Optimization, popularly known as SEO, is the process of helping websites rank better on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. When a user enters a query on these search engines, the algorithms of these search engines provide them with the most relevant results based on their query. So, SEO is the process of bringing your website to these relevant results in order to get more organic traffic to your website</p>

                                

                                <h3> 2. What is Organic Traffic? How is it Different from Paid Traffic?</h3>

                                <p>Organic traffic is the traffic that your website receives naturally through search engines. Paid traffic, on the other hand, is the traffic received by your website through paid ads. In other words, the search engines or websites where you have placed your ads refer your website to the people. Whereas, there is no referral involved with organic traffic</p>
                                

                                <h3>3. How Much does SEO Cost?</h3>

                                <p>The cost of SEO services depends on a lot of factors like current situation of your website, your approach, your end goal, and even the company you select for doing SEO. Most SEO companies that offer cheap services are well-known to use “black-hat” techniques that can severely damage your organic ranking credibility and might also result in a penalty. Thus, it is highly recommended that you should only hire a professional SEO services company to get the best results</p>

                                <h3>4. How Long does SEO Take to Work?</h3>
                                <p>This too depends on your approach and what you are trying to achieve with SEO. But with that being said, know that there is no overnight way to rank better on search engines. If by results you mean a considerable increase in website traffic and sales, this would most probably need at least 6 months, So consistent efforts and patience is most important for success in SEO</p>

                                

                                <h3>5. What is Crawling and Indexing?</h3>

                                <p>When you’ll start searching for SEO, you’ll often come across these terms. Crawling is when a search engine is going through the content of your website. When the search engine is crawling, the content which will appear in the searches is indexed. But remember that the search engine would not index all the content of your website. They’ll only select the content they find relevant</p>

                                

                                <h3> 6. What is PPC?</h3>
                                <p>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) is a marketing strategy where you’d pay a fee every time someone clicks on your ads. In simple words, it is one of the most popular ways to bring paid traffic to your website rather than only relying on organic traffic. Depending on your requirements and goals, your SEO service provider may or may not recommend PPC for your website</p>

                                

                                <h3>7. Is The Ranking Guaranteed?</h3>
                                <p>Most ethical SEO companies do not provide any kind of guarantee as they can’t really control the outcome. This is because search engines regularly update their algorithms and are constantly evolving. As a matter of fact, you should stay away from such companies that offer some kind of guarantee or claim that they have some special relationship with Google</p>

                                

                                <h3>8. What is the Difference Between On-Site and Off-Site SEO?</h3>
                                <p>On-site SEO is the process of optimizing pages of website, like the meta description, title, header tags, URL optimization, alt tags, SCHEMA implementation, etc. On the other hand, off-site SEO deals with other important aspects like link building, authority development, influencer outreach, review marketing, improving social media presence, etc.</p>

                               
                                <h3>9. What is better, On-Site SEO or Off-Site SEO?</h3>
                                <p>Both are equally important for a website to get a higher ranking on search engines. However, SEO service providers first improve the on-page elements of your website and then start working on off-site SEO.</p>

                                
                                <h3>10. I’ve Heard that Good Content Itself is Adequate for Good Rankings. Is This True?</h3>
                                <p>While good content is very important, it is not the only thing that can help you rank higher and retain that spot. There is a possibility that your competitors might also have as good or even better content on their website. So, apart from good content, factors like back links, social credibility, etc. are also very important</p>
                                
                                <h3>11. What are Back links?</h3>
                                <p>Backlinks or inbound links are created by a website to link to another website. The link created in the process is known as a backlink. The backlinks are one of the most important factors that search engines consider to rank a website</p>

                                <h3>12. How to Know if a Backlink is Good or Bad?</h3>
                                <p>Analysing the reputation of the website linking to your website can help you determine whether a backlink is good or bad. If a popular website links to your website, then the backlink is generally considered very beneficial for your SEO. However, it is very important that the popular website should be related to your website or industry in some way</p>

                                <h3>13 Is There a Penalty for Backlinks Coming from Bad Websites?</h3>
                                <p>Yes, your website can be penalized if your backlinks are coming from bad websites or websites that are not related to you and even websites that have already been penalized. Fortunately, as the business or website owner, you don’t really have to worry about this as every aspect of SEO would be taken care of by your SEO service provider.</p>

                                <h3>14. Is SEO Important for e-Commerce Websites Too?</h3>
                                <p>With the increasing competition online, the importance of SEO for eCommerce is greater than ever.
