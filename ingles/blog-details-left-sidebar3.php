                                    <h2>Why Do Websites need Maintenance?</h2>
                                    <p>This is a very important question to ponder upon. Your website is the
                                        gateway/window to your online business. The first thing a visitor encounters
                                        while trying to reach you online is your website. Upon reaching on the website,
                                        within seconds a visitor will take the very important decision that whether it
                                        is worth their time or not and to stay on it or not.</p>

                                    <p>A well-maintained website is important and can prove to be rewarding for your
                                        business. You don’t believe it? Right. Only if we get the details and the
                                        importance of doing so and what we can do to properly maintain the website, it
                                        will be quite easy for us to understand the usefulness of website maintenance.</p>
                                    <p>The security of your site is also at risk if you don’t keep it updated all the time. First things first, what makes a good site or even better should we discuss the other way around and have a look at how a poorly updated site is a bad one? This will give us a fair idea of what mistakes we don’t want to commit and should be cautious about.</p>
                                    <p>Let’s have a look at the negative impact caused by poor maintenance. A poorly maintained website can do a lot, want to know what?</p>

                                    <h3>1. Well, It Can Damage Your Corporate Image Pretty Much Badly.</h3>

                                    <p>Everything in the business world hugely relies on two things presentation and significance. Apart from this, the safety of your website is also at stake if it’s not regularly updated, doesn’t matter much if yours is a small site or a large one the risk is there.</p>

                                    <h3>2. You will Risk Losing your Existing Customers and Your Site will Never Attract New Visitors.</h3>
                                    <p>Customer’s expectations are high as they look for specific information on your sites. If it’s not updated how will they get that necessary information they’re looking for? By routinely refreshing the content and updating all the necessary information you will be able to better serve your customer.</p>

                                    <h3>3. It will Lead to Software Vulnerability and Taking the Access Control of your Old and Buggy Site is Pretty Easy.</h3>
                                    <p>A site lacking security patches is pretty easily discoverable by the hacker’s tools scanning the internet. To safeguard the access control, go for undiscoverable passwords and have a second factor of authentication as well.   </p>

                                    <h3>4. SEO Spam Might Happen.</h3>
                                    <p>The content of your website can be changed with a lot of spam pages and links being added to it by the attackers to exploit your website. SEO spam mostly affects the small sites to utilize them for spam link building schemes.</p>
                                    <p>As a professional seo services company, a long-term site maintenance plan is included in the services provided by us. But before hiring us and assigning the task to do so first you would like to have a look on the benefits of website maintenance and want to get a clear picture about why is it important to maintain your website. So, that you will have your checkpoints to make sure things are done as they are meant to be.</p>

                                    <h3>Importance of Website Maintenance</h3>
                                    <p>There are several reasons for updating your site but you should think more seriously about it because of some very important and obvious ones.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>First Importance is Security, Hackers Like Small Sites!</h3>
                                    <p>An old site that is not frequently updated is a very easy target for hackers. All they have to do is look for ‘view page source’ and get the information about what word press version you are running. You might be wondering why hackers will attack my site?</p>
